# Safe-Linear and Safe-Monotonic
This is the test code for experimental results in the paper *Best Arm Identification with Safety Constraints*([arxiv link here]).

Feel free to play around with the code if needed for your research purpose. A simple and fun way to learn about the code is to run the ipython notebook here.
